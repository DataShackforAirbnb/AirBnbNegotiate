Our place has 3 separate queen bedrooms in a luxury apartment setting; to be frank, I'm not sure you can find that within NYC for $110 per night near a subway (one-bedroom would be around that price).

Thank you for reaching out to us.  I believe that I have someone who will be jumping into this time slot.  It seems to be a snug fit.

I would recommend that you check out other offerings in our lovely neighborhood, or Brooklyn in general, which is quite vibrant (and safe) these days.

Best regards,
