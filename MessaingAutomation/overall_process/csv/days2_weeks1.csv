We would need to agree that you check out by 12P on the 31st as I have guests coming in on that day. If that's fine I can do $125 per night instead of the current rate of $150. Please let me know what you think.  *************** Hi Danielle, my name is Michele and I am interested in staying at your place for 2 days, from 2016-03-29 to 2016-03-31. The calendar is open on these days and I am wondering if it is still available? A little bit more about myself: I am a graduate student from Milan, Italy and study Communication Design. I am fond of exploring cultures and visual arts around the world.I will visit New York a few times this year to work on a project with a local school. I will be there with a collegue of mine, who will stay with me.  Since the trip is coming up very soon, and I found my schedule matches perfectly with the opening in your calendar, I am wondering if you would be willing to lower the rate to $110/night? I would be willing to make the booking immediately if the price is ok with you. *************** "
