Thank you so much for your message. Or calendars do match for those dates. The room is available but the discount you are asking me is a little to much. The room is usually listed for 79$/night. The reason it is listed for $59 is exactly because it is only two days available, a gap between other reservations. 

How about we meet in the middle and I lower the reservation cost from 59 to 49/night and we both get win? :)
