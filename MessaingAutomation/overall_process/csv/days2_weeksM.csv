These dates are currently free and I'd be happy to host you. Unfortunately our normal rates are $230 a night, so these dates are already heavily discounted. However I will send you a special offer with a bit more of a discount if that helps. Our place has 3 separate queen bedrooms in a luxury apartment setting; to be frank, I'm not sure you can find that within NYC for $110 per night near a subway (one-bedroom would be around that price).

I've adjusted the price to 170/night + cleaning fee, so you're welcome to finalize the booking.
Also, if you would like we will gladly give you some tips about discovering New York and everything it has to offer in terms of exploring different cultures of our city - we always keep updated list of the places and experiences worth seeing, and we're happy to share that with our guests.

The apartment is available and I'd be happy to host you, however the rate is firm. There is a discount for longer stays but for a short turnaround I cannot lower the rate. Feel free to ask any additional questions you may have, you are pre-approved to finalize your reservation at the current rate.
