The calendar is open on these days and I am wondering if it is still available? A little bit more about myself: I am a graduate student from Milan, Italy and study Communication Design. I am fond of exploring cultures and visual arts around the world. I am wondering if you would be willing to lower the rate to $20\/night? I would be willing to make the booking immediately if the price is ok with you."},"discount_asked":{"0":0.6,"1":0.7,"2":0.8,"3":0.9,"4":0.6,"5":0.7,"6":0.8,"7":0.9,"8":0.6,"9":0.7,"10":0.8,"11":0.9,"12":0.6,"13":0.7,"14":0.8,"15":0.9,"16":0.6,"17":0.7,"18":0.8,"19":0.9,"20":0.6,"21":0.7,"22":0.8,"23":0.9,"24":0.6,"25":0.7,"26":0.8,"27":0.9,"28":0.6,"29":0.7,"30":0.8,"31":0.9,"32":0.6,"33":0.7,"34":0.8,"35":0.9,"36":0.6,"37":0.7,"38":0.8,"39":0.9,"40":0.6,"41":0.7,"42":0.8,"43":0.9,"44":0.6,"45":0.7,"46":0.8,"47":0.9,"48":0.6,"49":0.7,"50":0.8,"51":0.9,"52":0.6,"53":0.7,"54":0.8,"55":0.9,"56":0.6,"57":0.7,"58":0.8,"59":0.9,"60":0.6,"61":0.7,"62":0.8,"63":0.9,"64":0.6,"65":0.7,"66":0.8,"67":0.9,"68":0.6,"69":0.7,"70":0.8,"71":0.9,"72":0.6,"73":0.7,"74":0.8,"75":0.9,"76":0.6,"77":0.7,"78":0.8,"79":0.9,"80":0.6,"81":0.7,"82":0.8,"83":0.9,"84":0.6,"85":0.7,"86":0.8,"87":0.9,"88":0.6,"89":0.7,"90":0.8,"91":0.9,"92":0.6,"93":0.7,"94":0.8,"95":0.9,"96":0.6,"97":0.7,"98":0.8,"99":0.9,"100":0.6,"101":0.7,"102":0.8,"103":0.9,"104":0.6,"105":0.7,"106":0.8,"107":0.9,"108":0.6}}
